Notes on Assignment 3

Parse the GO structure
  Focus on is_a and part_of relationships - treat identically


Parse the GO annotations file
  We don't care about publisher ID, so only record each organism entry once
  Need to decide data structure - will need to be accessed efficiently
  For any annotation, transfer up the chain
  networkx package has function for calculating ancestors (smthn like get_ancestors?)
